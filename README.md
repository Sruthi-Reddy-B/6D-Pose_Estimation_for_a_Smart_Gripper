# Vision-Driven-6D-Pose-Estimation-for-a-Smart-Gripper
Detect an object in an image and estimate its 6-D pose (3D position + 3D orientation), enabling an autonomous robot gripper to pick it precisely. This demo uses synthetic object data and YOLOv5 + Pose Estimation logic (simplified but conceptually accurate).
